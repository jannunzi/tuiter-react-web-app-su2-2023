    <p>
      Text documents are

      <input />

      broken up into several sections and subsections. Each section is usually
      prefaced with a short title or heading that attempts to summarize

      <img
        height="20px"
        src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Tesla-Bot-741x1024.jpg"
      />

      the topic of the section it precedes. For instance this paragraph is
      <b>preceded by the</b> heading Heading Tags. The font of the section
      headings <u>are usually larger</u> and bolder than their subsection
      headings. This document uses headings to introduce topics such as HTML
      Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. <i>HTML heading tags can</i> be
      used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as large
      headings. There are 6 heading tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is
      the largest heading and h6 is the smallest heading.

      To practice using the <span>heading tags we are going</span> to create
      several headings and subheadings to introduce the topics we will cover in
      this assignment. Under the public directory, create directory labs/a1
      where you will practice several HTML exercises for assignment 2. Under the
      labs/a1 directory, create an HTML file called index.html. Copy the HTML
      below into the body tag of this new file.
